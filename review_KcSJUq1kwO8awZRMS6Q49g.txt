The prices were at least $2 more than the LA location, but I guess its understandable since its Las Vegas. The fries weren't freshly prepared like the LA location either.

The dogs and sides were served up\/made in assembly line unlike the personal attention you get from one person at the LA location. \n\nOverall, it was just MEH. I'd rather drive 4 hours, then wait in line for another hour to have an authentic Pink's hotdog.

My other friend (a newyorker) and I thought it was good but agreed it wasn't awesome.  Considering the acclamation Pink's receives from born and bred LA-ers, I changed my assumption and decided it probably is better at the original stand in LA.  I remember thinking it wasn't as amazing of an experience as I was hoping to get - and was a bit disappointed by the lack of \"snap\" in the dog itself.  Also, it was a bit... much.  I have a feeling the dog had better snap to it before it got doused in the chili.   \n\nThat being said, I did enjoy my experience there.  It was exactly what I was looking for at that moment.  We were buzzed and looking to eat something extremely unhealthy but tasty - and that's exactly what we got.\n\nI'd definitely try it again because for some reason, I think it was just an off night.

Maybe I expected a little too much?  I mean how much can you expect from a hot dog?  Even then, I expected something just a little more special.

I heard that their hot dogs were very good and decided to try for myself.  There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Pink's--size and cost. I'll explain in a minute.\n\nJust to let everyone know, Pink's it outside of Planet Hollywood\/Miracle Mile Shops facing the boulevard.  I walked around for awhile till I found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  Anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so I went in to take a look at their menu.\n\nThe menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. At almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but I expected that from a famous hot dog eaterie.  They even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.\n\nI went for a guadalajara dog--sour cream, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic chili dog with onions.  We grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. When I saw our hot dogs I freaked out.  I love toppings, but really?  REALLY?  This was definitely a fork and knife dog.\n\nI love eating my hot dogs by hand.  It's just the way that it should be, but at Pink's it's difficult to do so.  Too many toppings on the dog cause the flavor of the dog to be lost, so I scraped EVERYTHING off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  The hot dog is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  I ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if I violated some ethical hot dog code by not eating with my hands.\n\nIf you want to try the dog, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a Pink's dog is all about.  If you want something really good, their chili dog was decent.\n\nOverall the dog was decent and I can at least say that I've tried it once.

Anyway, that morning we arrived, we decided to leave our comfy suite at Aria and to take a stroll down the strip.

I know what a Pink's hot dog tastes like and that was not a Pink's hot dog. It was soft and mushy and didn't have that firm, juicy texture that I'm accustomed to at the Pink's in LA. I firmly believe that if you're going to call yourself Pink's Hot Dogs, you better serve it up like it's Pink's Hot Dogs! \n\nAm I being a bit overdramatic? Maybe. But think of it like this... What if you walked into a McDonald's and ordered a Big Mac but it ended up looking like and tasting like something that came from an elementary school cafeteria? Or out of the back of some fat guy's ass? What then? I would rather pass out in the bosom of an obese woman with three eyes, one large breast and one little breast, and a tentacle hanging from her double-chin than eat another of those things. \n\nIf not for beer and gambling, I would have done nothing that entire weekend in Vegas but complain that it's not the same.

Going to college in Los Angeles, you're bound to go to Pink's at least once. After having it there, I really thought this place was overrated. The hot dogs were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nBecause of that, I really did not want to give this location a chance. However, we were leaving Las Vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. Hesitantly, I agreed to go to Pink's. And you know what, I'm really glad I did.\n\nFor those that do not know where Pink's is, it's outside on the strip. When we got here, I was honestly surprised that there was no line here. I had to initially do a double take to make sure I was at the right location. There were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that I was at the right place.\n\nDue to being hungry, I ordered the Spicy Mojave Dog and the Guadalajara Dog. The Guadalajara Dog was good, the mix of sour cream, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the hot dog. I'm not the biggest fan of relish, but I liked it in this case. The Spicy Mojave Dog was pretty awesome. To warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. I rarely eat hot dogs with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! The hot dogs have a nice pop when you take a bite, which I love in a hot dog.\n\nThere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. Especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\nOverall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The reason I rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the Hollywood location.

Personally one of the best hot dogs in my opinion is a Costco hot dog.  Practically every time I go to Costco, on my way out I have to buy a hot dog.  I've even purchased their refrigerated hot dogs to make at home - not the same as the ones they make there - I think because of the buns.  But I digress...\n\nI was in Vegas and having heard of Pinks being a southern California favorite, I realized these hot dogs needed to be sampled.  First of all, my challenge was finding the place.  I knew it was inside Planet Hollywood.  Upon walking in, I explored the mall, the food area, and even saw a big sign with an arrow pointing towards the casino\/mall exit.  But Pinks was nowhere to be found.  Well, turns out (after asking someone), it is in the front of the casino.  Ahhh.  It was one of those things - most Vegas places on the strip, you never really walk out in front of the casinos.  They are always designed to suck you in and never let you leave.  \n\nAnyway, after finding Pinks I ordered a Chicago dog and their standard footlong dog.  I should note that Pinks has a ton of hot dogs - their menu is quite extensive.  The Chicago dog was much thicker compared to the long and skinny footlong.  Both were ok.  They had been steamed.  Toppings were pretty basic.  No sport peppers on the Chicago dog, which I guess I can't complain about too much because we aren't in Chicago.  Buns were soft and tasted fresh.  \n\nOverall not an amazing hot dog like I had hoped for (still like that Costco hot dogs better), but certainty a very decent dog for Vegas.

I wasn't sure what to order until I saw the \"Mel B\" dog, which had (if I remember correctly): nacho cheese, onions, sour cream, guac, hot peppers, and mustard? All my favourite things...once again, Scary Spice saves the day!\n\nThe gal working at the counter was super smiley and friendly. Our hot dogs only took a few minutes to make.\n\nThe bun is pretty small, but very soft and yummy. The dog had that perfect \"snap\" to it when you bite in...mmm. The dog itself was one of the best I've had, I think!\nIn terms of toppings...they REALLY load them on. The onions were pretty big (same with the peppers), and there's tons of each thing, so there wound up being a kind of bad ration of toppings to hot dog. I managed to eat it with my hands (no knife and fork), but barely. Next time I'd get less on top.\n\nOverall, though, it was really tasty and I will definitely go back next time I'm near a Pink's. (Le Chien Chaud in Calgary is still my top dog, though!)", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-06", "type": "review"}

While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.\n\nMaybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.\n\nAs for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.\n\nUnfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.\n\nOverall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had. You'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end.", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-19", "type": "review"}

It might help if you were a little tipsy as well to cushion the realization of the resources you are exhausting for minimal nutritional value. Hey, it's Vegas. Luckily for myself, I barely beat the lunch rush, was able to walk up and order, and got my dog in just a few minutes. But the line a few minutes later was crazy! Unfortunately for me though, it was also December and freezing outside.

We got fries, but the couple next to us got the onion rings and we were really eyeballing them.  I finally asked the guy how they were, and he said they were awesome and offered us his last ring.  How cool is that?  We both made lame gestures saying, no, no, we couldn't, but the guy insisted, so E took it.  Awesome indeed.  So next day, we went back for dogs again and yep, had the onion rings.  Really good stuff.  Coating was crispy, onions cooked perfectly - not limp, but they don't have that harsh onion bite, and like another reviewer said, the coating and onions don't separate so you get onions and coating all in one bite.  \n\nIt was hot, but we got a table under an umbrella and there are fan\/misters blasting.

Compared to back home, which is in LA, I think I'll choose the one in LA. But since my boyfriend never had Pinks in either location, I decided to pop his Pinks hot dog cherry. WHOA that sounded a little inappropriate lol. But here goes:\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Planet Hollywood dog which is loaded with bacon, cheese, mushroom, and err did i mention bacon?! and i ordered the pastrami Britain dog which is just a regular hot dog with Swiss cheese and pastrami. Holy moly, the planet Hollywood dog is monstrous compared to my pastrami dog. If you put then next to each other, it looks like umm you know what evolving. Boy becomes a man. Haha. Since the polish dog and the bacon overload was too much for the buns, it looked quite messy. Well, with two hot dogs, a side of fries, and a coke... Our total was $18. Bull!\n\nPros:\n-short line... Fast food\n-addicting fries and onion rings\n-good portion... Very filling for me especially the fries\n-opens late so it's good for after clubbing or unless you're a fatty like me and wants to have a midnight dinner err snack..\n-they sell jello shots here\n\nCons:\n-even though the line is short, it's so boring. I like that rush of excitement where you see people all hyped up about it order a ton of food and end up not finishing it\n-very greasy... Made my buns soggy \n-overpriced hot dogs that I can get at Costco for only $1.50 with a free drink\n-outdoor seatings only\n-my boyfriend wasnt satisfied so it made me look bad.

Heading into the first bite, I definitely did have high expectations, mainly because I was hungry, and also because the prices looked pretty darn high, even after accounting for the recent Groupon deal. However, keep in mind that this in in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, so really you'd almost expect it to be pricey. It's not fair to compare this to Costco hot dogs on price.\n\nWhen I tried my friend's chili cheese dog, my eyes, taste buds, and probably everything else just lit up. Yeah, hunger is the best sauce or whatever, but every component of that dog - bun, sausage, chili, and grilled onions - was really delicious and made me wish that I had chosen it. Instead, I had gone with the Planet Hollywood dog, which was also quite tasty with bacon and some sort of enhanced 'shrooms. I also loved the polish sausage, which is fatter than the normal wiener, and the nacho cheese went surprisingly well with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nWe also shared some deluxe chili cheese fries, which had a crapload of toppings on them. In hindsight, if I had known how loaded the hot dogs would be, I would've ordered normal fries for about half the price because my friend was pretty much evacuating his toppings onto the fries. Oh well, live and learn.\n\nAnyway, I've seen the other reviews, and I'm sure it doesn't match everything that people like about the original Pink's - which I still hope to go to some day - but it's still good eating. Not considering the price, the only problem I have is that I'd rather go to Earl of Sandwich, which is right next door and which I love to death, so I might not really see this place much at all in the future.

RIDICULOUSLY expensive.\n\nNever again.\n\nI had a polish\/pastrami \"classic\" thing, SUPPOSEDLY with swiss. (Swiss air?)

(Then again, we've heard sad rumors about the original, too, but we can't vouch, as we haven't been in so long.)\n\nSo avoid this joint, if you know better!\n\nPS And you know what the WORST thing about this is? This franchise of Pink's is run by Block 16 Hospitality, the same people that brought to LV the following restaurants: Holstein's, LBS Burgers, Barrymore, Public House.

I've been living in San Diego for a year now, after having lived in LA and I miss Pinks. So when I was in Vegas and saw Pinks on the strip I got really excited. As soon as I walked in, I should have known. This place is everything pink and looks like a retro 50's diner. This caught me off guard considering the real Pinks is basically a rundown bungalow covered in photographs and the only thing that's actually pink is the sign out front. Next was the menu. I didn't recognize a single 'special hot dog'. The original Pinks special hot dogs either have a LA themed name or are named after a celebrity. The Pinks in Las Vegas has special dogs named with a Las Vegas theme. So I had to ask the girl at the front counter if they knew which dogs were renamed and which dog was the Martha Stewart dog. She had a list behind the counter that listed which special hot dogs were renamed but she told me that most of their special dogs were not their own creations, not renamed dogs from the original location. Uhhhh... ok. So basically this Pinks is a completely different restaurant with the name Pinks slapped on.\n\nNow for the food. I ordered a Chili Cheese Dog (with a Polish sausage subbed for the hot dog) with mustard and a side of fries, totally $13 and some odd cents. I waited a few minutes and my order number was called. I went to retrieve my food and got really confused as soon as I saw the French fries which are nothing like the LA Pinks French fries. I made a comment to the person who gave me my food about it looking nothing like food from the original Pinks, and a woman, also from LA, walked up behind me and said the same. \n\nSo was the food good? Yeah, it was decent. But not worth the 13 bucks I spent on it. The shoe-string fries were nothing like the Cajun fries (that the LA Pinks serves) I was expecting but the were good nonetheless. Worth the $5.99 I paid for them? No. But that's what you get for eating on the strip. The Polish sausage was pretty good and the chili was... not so flavorful. But overall I'm glad I tried it.\n\nThe verdict: if you're on the strip near Planet Hollywood and craving hot dogs, this is probably the best you'll find. However, if you're a lover of the original Pinks and have your heart set on your usual order, don't come here. You'll leave with a craving that wasn't curbed, disappointed, and with a wallet that weighs less than when you walked in.", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-30", "type": "review"}

We learned that the hard way. -_-\n\nI ordered the Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog. I like keeping my dogs plain, and dressed with mustard. So I enjoyed this dog, but would have liked it even more if the pastrami came out hot, rather than lukewarm.\n\nI also sampled some of the bf's Bacon Burrito Dog (2 dogs, bacon, chili, cheese, onions). We ordered the dog without onions, but it came out standard, so he brought it back to have it re-made. The cook was nice about it, probably because there was hardly a line at 4 pm, and served up a new one within 3 minutes, spit-free! It was interesting... glad we tried, but wouldn't order it again. It is also best eaten with the wrapper, because the burrito drips chili grease... yum!\n\nWith our $15 Groupon, we had to fork out a whopping $0.52. Overall, $7.52...

I have no idea why people couldn't concept that idea because it seemed like the place was crowded with confused people looking for a line. \n\nPrice: I believe in LA prices for Pinks are around $3.50-$5 bucks, reasonable. Nope not at Planet Hollywood it was about $8.95+ a hotdog. Honestly for the quality of food and the service combined it really wasn't worth it. \n\nAmbiance: outside seating, super hot it was pretty annoying.

Then I saw that we were about six blocks from the valet stand, again with no valet in view.  So, off to self-parking we went, with uniformed police everywhere, to find a parking spot.  At length we found one--the only one.  Something unusual was definitely going on.\n\nSo, Diane and I walked from the parking garage into the Miracle Mile shops, and walked and walked.  As we finally reached the entrance to Planet Hollywood on the other side of the shopping promenade, 9 uniformed sheriff's deputies were assembled together, and fashionably suited males and well-dressed females were everywhere.  About then I realized that we had left the Groupon in the car.  Oh, well (sigh).  I decided that I wasn't going to walk all the way back and return again just to save a mere $5!  So, we continued on and out the main doors until we finally saw Pink's facing Las Vegas Boulevard, and examined the vast menu on the wall before making our selections.\n\nThis story does end well.  I really enjoyed my Brooklyn Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog with pickles, onions, mustard, and sauerkraut added, on a soft Old Country bun.  It included a generous amount of tender pastrami, and although the hot dog was thin, it was long and had a very nice snap to it when one bit into the casing.  Beer-battered Onion Rings and nicely salted Shoestring Fries were both good and tasty.  And I liked the mild Nacho Cheese Sauce for dipping my Fries, while Diane enjoyed Mini Corn Dogs.  To my surprise, one single hot dog sufficed to quell my appetite.  And, there were free refills of lemonade and all other available soft drinks.  \n\nThe place is nothing fancy, seating is all outside, and there is only counter service.  But staff members were friendly and helpful.  We had a nice view of the Strip before us, but it was a mite cold and windy at 10:47 p.m.  Heat lamps were present, but not in service.  Hard driving music overhead added to the casual ambiance.  So, we finished our food, walked all the way back to the car, and left the parking lot as we were directed out by at least 6 police officers.  Just as we were turning onto Tropicana Avenue, Diane asked the last officer if she knew what was going on at Planet Hollywood, and was told, \"Soul Train Awards!\"\n\nNow I'm sort of glad that I still have my Groupon for Pink's, which, as luck would have it, does not really expire for another month.  For, it means that I can return again soon to enjoy another tasty classic dog!", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-15", "type": "review"}

I get that shredded premade veggies may be easier but who puts diced tomatoes on a burger? It made it really messy to eat. And at almost 9 bucks for a standard burger (with no fries or drink) I expected a little more. My friends mushroom dog had mushrooms that tasted old and my other friend got the bacon chili dog. We all got halfway through and looked at each other with dissatisfied faces and tossed the rest. Sadly, I think you'd be better off at a McDonalds.\n\nOh and to top it off some blaring alarm was going off the whole time and no one seemed to mind it or address to their customers that everything was fine or that it would be turned off shortly. I think it was the fire alarm, Idk lights were flashing and a siren going. I understand that it may have been out of their control, but I think good customer service would have acknowledged it and let the customer know the roof wasn't going to fall in or something like that.", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-06-18", "type": "review"}

I'm from LA and have been to the original Pinks, so my initial feelings were a bit mixed, but I decided to give a go.    \n\nWe had about an hour before our movie started so we figured we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  A nice bonus of this location was that we were able to sit around the edge of the restaurant and watch college football in the sports betting area.  I was hoping that my Rival College team would lose, but I guess that is what I get for wishing ill on a team...even my rivals.\n\nIf there were half stars I would have given Pink's 3.5, but I rounded down for a couple reasons.  One of reasons was that the speed of service left a bit to be desired.  It was a pretty busy Saturday night and they only had two people working (one in the kitchen and one at the register) so service was slow.  There was a part of me that thought the menu items were a little over priced...but I rounded down more for the slow service\n\nNow to the important part, the food:\n\nThe Las Vegas hot dog - Came with cheese, chili, jalapenos, guacamole and two hot dogs.  This was definitely the better of the two dogs we tried.  It was a little less than $7.  Really though how can you not like chill and cheese on a hot dog...everything else was just a bonus.\n\nThe Spicy Mojave (with sauerkraut) - The extra sauerkraut definitely saved this hot dog.  It just didn't seem like much without it, especially for almost $7.  \n\nChili Cheese Fries - I think this was the highlight of the meal.  There was a great portion of chili and cheese.  And the fries were perfect.  They were a little thicker on than a pencil, crispy outside soft inside.\n\nIf you are looking for some comfort fast food while watching a game...or many games at once...this could be a fun spot for you to hit.", "business_id": "KcSJUq1kwO8awZRMS6Q49g", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-11-06", "type": "review"}

The basic hot dog is incredibly overpriced--$5 for one with nothing on it. The options with a selection of toppings are way better deals, at around $9 after tax. Pink's is pretty over-hyped though, either way. The hog dog itself was alright, and it did have a bit of the \"snap\" that other reviewers mention, but the hot dog bun was definitely a letdown. It was cold and basically tastes like something you get out of a bag from the grocery store that's been sitting around maybe a few days too long--it's edible but just doesn't add anything at all to the hot dog. My friend had a few too many drinks, and even he knew better than to eat the bun, instead eating his hog dog and toppings with a fork and knife. \n\nOverall, it's a decent meal if you want to spend three times as much on a hot dog as you should, but IMO, Pink's is nothing to get excited about.
